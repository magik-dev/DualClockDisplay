# CS-210

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project required me to create a program that displayed two clocks simultaneously, one in a 12-hour format, and the other in a 24-hour format. A core feature of this program is the ability to manually increment the time by an hour, a minute, or a second. If the time was not incremented, then it gave the user the ability to terminate the program. The purpose of the project was to practice modular development, making sure there was the least amount of code possible within the main function. It also served as practice working with supporting materials meant to guide the development process, such as a flowchart and functional requirements document.

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I excelled concerning the main objective of the project, being able to write modular functions, so as not to blote the main function with too much code. I accomplished this by not only writing functions but by also keeping those functions in separate files from the main function. I further separated those functions by declaring them in header files and then defining them in .cpp files. I also made sure to include header file guards so as a precautionary measurement against including any one header file more than once in another file.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
At the time of the development of this program, I hadn't yet learned about classes. So, if I were to recreate this project in the future, then I would make sure to use classes if it felt appropriate to do so. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I felt that the proper separation and inclusion of the header and .cpp files for the modular functions was a bit difficult to grasp the concept of; however, throughout the development process, I learned how to do it properly. A resource that I use is the zyBooks reading material, as well as Stack Overflow. These two resources always provide valuable information. The first is my course textbook which I always refer to when I encounter a problem, and the second is a forum that usually contains a thread of someone asking a similar question about a coding problem I have.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
From a technical standpoint, being able to properly implement modular code by creating functions in separate files will improve my ability to create more complex programs in an organized manner. Assuming the coursework and other projects continue to require more and more code, then this skill will surely aid me in accomplishing what I need to do. From a professional standpoint, being able to match company/client/professor expectations about how the program should look/function by utilizing provided flowcharts and functional requirements documents will be of great benefit to me.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By utilizing separate files, it becomes easier to modify the program in terms of functionality. I made sure to separate the types of functions as well, so clock functions that manually adjust the time are separated from the functions that are involved in printing the time. This allows for greater maintainability because I can come back to this project and know exactly where everything is located and why. I also made sure to include comments that explain the purpose of the program and how it works in the source file. There are also inline comments to help discern what each aspect of the code does.
